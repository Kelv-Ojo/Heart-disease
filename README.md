Heart Disease Data Analysis with Power BI
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a heart disease dataset using Power BI to provide insights into key trends and patterns related to cardiovascular health. The dataset is sourced from the UCI Heart Disease repository and includes 2943 entries with various patient attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease status. The goal is to create a comprehensive dashboard that can be used by healthcare professionals to make informed decisions regarding patient treatment and resource management.

Key Features
Data Visualization: The Power BI dashboard includes multiple visualizations such as line graphs, pie charts, and bar graphs that explore the relationship between variables like age, cholesterol, and heart disease presence.
Interactive Filters: Users can filter the data based on patient demographics such as age, gender, and cholesterol levels for more focused insights.
KPI Monitoring: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are implemented to track trends in heart disease progression and assess the effectiveness of treatments.
Custom Reports: The dashboard provides real-time, drill-down capabilities for a detailed analysis of heart disease factors, enabling healthcare professionals to create personalized treatment plans.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes the following features:

Age (in years)
Sex (Male/Female)
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure (in mmHg)
Cholesterol Level (in mg/dL)
Fasting Blood Sugar (>120 mg/dL)
Resting ECG Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise-Induced Angina
ST Depression Induced by Exercise
Heart Disease Presence (1 = present, 0 = absent)
Insights and Findings
Age and Heart Disease: The analysis shows a strong correlation between increasing age and the likelihood of heart disease.
Cholesterol and Heart Disease: Higher cholesterol levels are a key indicator of potential heart disease in patients.
Chest Pain Types: Different chest pain types provide useful information for diagnosing heart disease.
Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for creating the interactive dashboard and visualizing the dataset.
Data Cleaning: Data was cleaned and pre-processed within Power BI to remove inconsistencies and outliers.
How to Use
Download the .pbix file from the repository.
Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
Interact with the dashboard using the filters and visuals to explore insights.
Use the KPI section to monitor key metrics related to heart disease.
Future Improvements
Include predictive analytics models to forecast heart disease risk based on patient data.
Integrate more datasets for a comprehensive analysis of cardiovascular conditions.
Add real-time data integration for continuous monitoring.
